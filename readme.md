# A simple, modular, extensible chat platform
<p align="center"><img src="moo.png" width=256 alt="Moo Logo"/> mooooooooooo</p>

---------------------
Moo is a Java based chat service written as test bed for various concepts. It 
features a modular design, which separates the concepts of a UI, client and a 
server. As a result, a UI can be developed based on a common chat API, without 
compile time dependency on neither client or a server. Depending on which server 
is running, a UI only needs a compatible runtime client dependency.

My goal in writing `moo` was to achieve practical, working example of a 
modular chat service with at least two client/server implementations that 
can be simply swapped without affecting UI. Similarly, I wanted to come up with a 
practical and intuitive API that makes building any user interface straightforward. 
As a result of my initial goals, `moo` is not feature rich nor is it optimized for 
performance. It only provides the very basic chat functionality.

If you're looking for a working example of a chat application, web sockets or 
JMS, complete test suite powered by Mockito, high code coverage, then you may 
find moo a happy place to poke around.

### Stack

 * Java 8
 * Web Sockets
 * (J)ava (M)essaging (S)ervice (ActiveMQ)
 * Spring Boot
 * Mockito

### Features

 * Distributed Architecture
 * Server JMX reporting
 * Console UI

 * Single public chat hall

## Defaults
---------------------
By default `moo` is bound to a web socket client. It expects a running web 
socket server.

## Screenshots
---------------------
Moo running on web sockets client/server:

Moo running on JMS client/server with ActiveMQ broker (not shown):

![Shell UI Screenshot](/docs/images/moo-ui-shell-jms.png?raw=true "Moo Shell UI in Action")

In both screenshots we have a 4 way tmux session. In the left upper corner we're running moo server. In 
the right upper we have a moo reader which displays chat activity. In both bottom corners, 
we're running two instances of a writer, simulating user chat experience. In a typical use 
case, end user would run one instance of a reader and writer only.

There are some subtle but interesting UI behavioral differences depending on 
which client/server implementation is used. For example, with web sockets when 
server is aborted messages generated by the writer are lost. This is not the 
case with a JMS server, as messages are retained by the broker and delivered 
when server is started again. Try it :-)

## First things first
---------------------
Make a local build:
```
cd moo/
mvn install
```

## Server
---------------------
Starting server:
```
cd moo/moo-server-IMPL/
mvn spring-boot:run
```
IMPL = one of the available implementations: `moo-server-socket` or 
`moo-server-jms`. Details about each server are available in the server 
project readme.

## Client
---------------------
Depending on which server is running, a compatible client runtime dependency 
of a UI app is required. For example, for text based shell UI, a socket compatible 
client would be enabled by commented out the following in `moo-ui-shell/moo-ui-shell-reader/pom.xml` 
and `moo-ui-shell/moo-ui-shell-writer/pom.xml`:
```
<!--
only one moo-client implementation can be enabled otherwise spring 
IOC will not resolve injection points due to multiple implementations
-->
<dependency>
  <groupId>pl.zimowski</groupId>
  <artifactId>moo-client-socket</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<!--
<dependency>
  <groupId>pl.zimowski</groupId>
  <artifactId>moo-client-jms</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.activemq</groupId>
  <artifactId>activemq-core</artifactId>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
-->
```

## UI
---------------------
Starting console UI requires two terminal sessions. It's probably easiest to 
split terminal session into two using something like `screen` or `tmux`.

First, start UI reader which will allow to view public chats:
```
cd moo/moo-ui-shell/moo-ui-shell-reader
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Reader running on websocket client will attempt to connect to server at 
`localhost` on port `8000`. This can be re-configured via 
`application.properties`, or more conveniently, by overriding these spring 
managed props as command line args. Client aborts immediately if server 
connection cannot be established.

To be able to actually send chat messages, it is necessary to have a running 
instance of a writer:
```
cd moo/moo-ui-shell/moo-ui-shell-writer
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Because writer uses the same client as reader, same customization strategy 
applies. If server is based on websockets, then websocket client should be 
used. If server is based on JMS, then JMS client should be used, etc.

## Code Coverage
---------------------
Playing around with [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/mrazjava/moo) Github plugin, 
found it interesting but imperfect. The readme badge is really nice, but it is not 
reliably updated when coverage changes and there are a lot of complaints about it posted 
on the web. For me, sometimes it updates instantly, other times takes 24 hours. Don't 
trust the badge. The sure way to verify code coverage is to invoke suite locally:
```
cd moo/
mvn clean verify
```
Then check `jacoco` reports:
```
cd moo-reports/target/site/jacoco-aggregate/
```
and open `index.html` in your favorite browser.

## Care to help or join?
---------------------
This could be more fun with graphical UIs. For example, web based on Angular. Or Eclipse 
RCP. Or JavaFX. You get the point. I just don't have that much time, besides my 
`moo` itch was scratched with what you see here. I may come back to this from time to 
time to experiment more or of `moo` hack will itch me again :-) If you feel like hacking on, 
please issue a PR against `develop` branch and I will happily merge your improvements. Other 
areas of improvemnts are obviously server/api/feature related.

*Enjoy!*
